  - Aug'19 - Jun'20 Senior Executive
    - Worked on a Churn Prediction Model for 10M customers that provided with monthly predictions for the CVM team to run campaigns. Did post campaign analytics to help them identify better offers for specific kind of customers.
    - Worked on a P2P conversion model, basically converting Prepaid customers to Postpaid customers. The model used an ensemble of 3 models and was developed in python.
    - Worked on bill shock analysis, Identfying and profiling customers recieving bill shock (bill exponentially higher than monthly fee) to reduce churn. Profiled and built a model using Random Forest Classifier in python to target the customers with future risk.
  - Aug'18 - Jul'19 Graduate Engineer trainee
