    - Worked on an Inactivity Model, this was used to help the market in reducing the customer churn and increase the service usage! 
    - The soluiton included an ensemble model for propensity for customer to become inactive, a clustering to cluster the customers on the basis of their usage and revenue patters to help with the campaign design and a response model to help with the customer targeting. 
    - Worked on a fraud use case to find users who are abusing the network with fraudlent activities pretaining to the IRSF and Wangiri cases. The model was developed in two ways, supervised and unsupervised to check for the best performance. Later the outputs from both the models was taken by the Fraud team as they both provided insights and captured cases.
    - Worked on a Chatbot serving 34M customers in Kenya (Zuri-bot), helped in adding subintents and conversation actions and identifying the point of loss of interests in the whole customer experience. The customer interaction and the chat length was increased by 10% resulting in an increase in the NPS(Net Promoter Score) from 8.1 to 8.6 in 6 months.
    - Worked on Customer Lifetime Value which helped the buisness user in gauging the acquision quality. The model was developed in python using Kaplan Meier Survival technique. The output was integrated to a BI dashboard.

  **- Aug'19 - Jun'20 Senior Executive**
    - Worked on a Churn Prediction Model for 10M customers that provided with monthly predictions for the CVM team to run campaigns. Did post campaign analytics to help them identify better offers for specific kind of customers.
    - Worked on a P2P conversion model, basically converting Prepaid customers to Postpaid customers. The model used an ensemble of 3 models and was developed in python.
    - Worked on bill shock analysis, Identfying and profiling customers recieving bill shock (bill exponentially higher than monthly fee) to reduce churn. Profiled and built a model using Random Forest Classifier in python to target the customers with future risk.
  **- Aug'18 - Jul'19 Graduate Engineer trainee**
    - Worked in multiple teams (CVM, Finance, Digital Analyics, BI and Visualizations) to get a firm understanding of the buisness practices.
